# Netflix-Data-Analysis
In this analysis, I investigate Netflix/IMDB data of movies uploaded to the platform since 2021, 
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualizing the data
- Dashboard
- Predictive Modelling (predicting whether movie is in English or not)

  The data was retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luiscorter/netflix-original-films-imdb-scores)
